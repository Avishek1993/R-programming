makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv <- NULL

    x <<- y

## Write a short comment describing this function
## This function will calculate the inverse of the matrix created by the makeCacheMatrix function above.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  inv <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(inv)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(inv)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  inv <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(inv)
  inv
}
